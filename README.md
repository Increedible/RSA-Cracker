# RSA-Cracker
Rudimentary application of the General Number Field Sieve to find two prime factors.

Try to use it on https://bigprimes.org/RSA-challenge!

Set p and q to two prime numbers (how bigger how slower obviously) and the program will find them! If you don't trust it you can also just set the product n directly within the code and the algorithm will find it anyways. This is one of the best current ways to brute-force a crack on RSA encryption; but obviously it isn't very efficient, otherwise our world wouldn't rely on RSA!

Use this to find p and q incase you want to try it yourself: https://bigprimes.org/
