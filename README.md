# RSA-Cracker
Rudementary application of the General Number Field Sieve to find two prime factors.

Set p and q to two prime numbers (how bigger how slower obviously) and the program will find them! If you don't trust it you can also just set the product n directly within the code and the algorithm will find it anyways. This is one of the best current ways to brute-force a crack on RSA encryption; but obviously it isn't very efficient, otherwise our world wouldn't rely on RSA!
